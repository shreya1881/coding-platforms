# coding platforms :books:
For placements, practicing coding is very important. There are a lot of coding platforms available online which prove to be very helpful regarding placement and practicing coding. I will be writing down some of the platforms on the basis of difficulty level according to me. <br />
1. Hackerrank - This platform has questions right from the most basic level to an advanced level. It provides you a choice to choose whichever language you prefer writing code in. Its a great platform for beginners. <br />
2. GFG (Geeks for Geeks)- I preferably, love the interface of GFG. It's so user freindly and easy to navigate through. It has partwise questions on each topic and according to all the difficulty levels. From, School, Basic, Easy, Medium to Hard, there are questions from all the difficulty levels under every topic. <br />
3. Codechef - In this platform, you wont be given any code snippet already. You have to write the entire code on your own. The level of questions are much higher than Hackerrank and a little bit higher that GFG. <br />
4. Leetcode - This is the hardest platform I have encountered till now. Here, optimizing your code to the best possible solution also plays a very important role. You have to keep in mind the complexities while you code on this platform. <br />
5. Codeforces
6. Codewars
